    Kier, PE — Lumon Industries wishes to address recent coverage and speculation surrounding comments made during 
    Helly R.: A Severed Story, our celebratory gala recognizing milestones in the Severance program.
</p>
<p>
    During the evening's proceedings, Helena Eagan—whose steadfast commitment to Lumon and the Severance initiative 
    is well-documented—spoke in a manner that, while unexpected, has since been clarified. Ms. Eagan has stated that 
    her remarks were the result of overindulgence during the festivities. She has expressed regret for any confusion 
    this created and has reaffirmed both her personal pride in the program and her family’s enduring support for Lumon 
    Industries.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to emphasize that Helly R.: A Severed Story was, by all accounts, a resounding success. The event 
    brought together employees, partners, and invited guests to reflect on the extraordinary progress and 
    transformative potential of Severance. From interactive showcases to personal testimonials, attendees gained an 
    inspiring view of how focus, alignment, and trust in Kier’s vision are helping shape a more harmonious future.

<p>
    Isolated incidents of misunderstanding should not overshadow the remarkable achievements celebrated that evening, 
    nor the tireless dedication of the many individuals who make Lumon’s mission possible. As with any vibrant 
    gathering, emotions can rise and moments may be misinterpreted. What remains constant, however, is the clarity 
    of purpose that guides Lumon and the Severance program.
</p>
<p>
    In light of recent conversations, Lumon also reaffirms its commitment to the welfare of all employees, including 
    those who serve with distinction on the Severed Floor. Lumon leadership is undertaking a comprehensive review to 
    ensure that workplace practices continue to reflect the highest standards of safety, dignity, and innovation. 
    Appropriate adjustments will be made to strengthen the experience of every participant in the Severance program, 
    ensuring that the balance between individual well-being and organizational excellence is maintained.

    “We view Helena's words not as a disruption, but as a reminder that even in our most innovative spaces, humanity 
    remains at the center,” said a Lumon spokesperson. “We are grateful for her honesty, and even more grateful for 
    the unwavering trust our employees and community continue to place in our mission.”
</p>
<p>
    Lumon Industries thanks all attendees and supporters for their enthusiasm, their patience, and their ongoing 
    commitment to our shared future. Together, guided by Kier’s enduring light, we continue to move forward—steadily, 
    purposefully, and with pride.
